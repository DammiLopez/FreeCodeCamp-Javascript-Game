## 🚀 Key Features & Learning Milestones

The repository is organized into several modular projects, each focusing on a specific core game development technique:

* **Sprite Animation:** Implementing different animation states (idle, run, jump) using sprite sheets.
* **Parallax Backgrounds:** Creating depth with multi-layered, endlessly scrolling backgrounds.
* **Enemy Movement Patterns:** Scripting unique AI behaviors and flight/movement paths.
* **Collision Detection:** Mastering mathematical checks for circle and rectangle collisions.
* **State Design Pattern:** Managing complex player behaviors using a clean, professional code structure.
* **Mobile Support:** Adapting games for touch controls and responsive canvas scaling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5 Canvas:** For rendering high-performance 2D graphics.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** OOP principles, classes, and modular code logic.
* **CSS3:** Game UI layout and responsive design.
